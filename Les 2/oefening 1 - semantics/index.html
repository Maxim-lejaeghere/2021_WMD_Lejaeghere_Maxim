<h2>Dummy text: Its function as a filler or as a tool for comparing the visual impression of different typefaces</h2>

<p>
Dummy text is text that is used in the publishing industry or by web designers to occupy the space which will
later be filled with 'real' content. This is required when, for example, the final text is not yet available. Dummy
text is also known as 'fill text'. It is said that song composers of the past used dummy texts as lyrics when
writing melodies in order to have a 'ready-made' text to sing with the melody. Dummy texts have been in use
by typesetters since the 16th century.
